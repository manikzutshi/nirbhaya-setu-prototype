Nirbhaya Setu

Empowering Women, Securing Our Communities

A next-generation safety platform integrating artificial intelligence, IoT sensors, and community feedback to provide real-time protection and genuine peace of mind in public spaces. Built by Team Aura Farmers to transform how cities approach women's safety through technology and trust.

The Data: A Crisis of Safety

Women's safety in urban environments has reached a critical threshold. Current statistics reveal a deeply concerning pattern: pervasive fear, rising crime, and environmental factors that systematically undermine women's freedom of movement and quality of life.

40% of Urban Women Report Feeling Unsafe

Pervasive Fear

According to the NARI 2025 Report, 40% of urban women feel "not so safe" or "unsafe" in their daily environments—a stark indicator of systemic vulnerability.

The Nightly Drop

Safety perception on public transport plummets dramatically from 70% during the day to just 36% at night, revealing a dangerous vulnerability during evening and late-night hours.

Rising Crime Trajectory

Crimes against women increased 12.9% between 2018-2022, with 445,256 cases registered in 2022 alone—demonstrating an accelerating trend that demands immediate intervention.

Environmental research confirms these fears are grounded in reality. Studies from Stockholm and Ahmedabad directly link poor lighting, reduced visibility, and inadequate infrastructure maintenance to higher harassment incidents and diminished perceived safety.

The Trust Deficit: Why Current Systems Are Failing

Massive Underreporting: Only 1 in 3 women who experience harassment report it to authorities. This underreporting gap means the true scope of safety issues remains invisible to official records and policy responses.


Institutional Distrust

Just 25% of women trust that authorities will act effectively on their complaints. This confidence gap reflects systemic failures in response time, investigation quality, and accountability.

The Action Gap

Even when formally registered, action is taken in only 16% of cases. This disparity between reported incidents and actual interventions undermines confidence in institutional protection.

Real-World Consequences

The fear transcends perception. Research shows women will accept lower-quality educational institutions to access safer routes. In the UK, 23% of women avoid certain areas entirely during darker months—a tangible restriction of freedom.

The Clear Need: These failures create demand for a decentralized solution that empowers women directly, mobilizes trusted contacts immediately, and engages community guardians—bypassing institutional bottlenecks.

The Crisis We're Solving

Women across urban centers face persistent safety threats in public spaces. Inadequate street lighting leaves dark corridors vulnerable. Without reliable information about safe routes, women navigate based on fear rather than fact. Emergency response times remain dangerously slow. And when incidents occur, isolated victims lack immediate community support or intervention.

Inadequate Lighting

Poor visibility in public areas increases vulnerability and perpetuates fear-based movement patterns.

Unsafe Routes

Lack of reliable safety data forces women to make dangerous choices without essential information.

Delayed Response: Emergency services cannot mobilize quickly without real-time location data and situational awareness.

Limited Support: Isolated incidents occur with no community awareness, preventing collective intervention and learning.

How Nirbhaya Setu Works

Our five-stage safety flow provides seamless protection from the moment a woman plans her journey through real-time incident response. The system continuously learns and adapts, improving safety outcomes across the entire community.

Pre-Journey Safety Check: Users access an AI-powered safety score for their destination within the app, based on IoT data, real-time lighting conditions, crowd density, and aggregated reviews from local women before leaving home.

Live Route Monitoring: GPS tracking combined with anomaly detection identifies route deviations or unexpected stops during travel, such as when a ride-share driver takes an unfamiliar path.

Instant Community & Authority Alerts: Emergencies trigger immediate alerts to trusted contacts, nearby community guardians, and emergency services with exact live location data for rapid response.

Smart Alert Differentiation: The system distinguishes between warning stages (suspicious activity requiring caution) and distress stages (confirmed danger requiring immediate intervention).

Continuous Learning & Improvement: Machine learning refines predictions by incorporating real-time feedback from user reviews, incident reports, and community surveys, making the system smarter daily.

Core Features: Complete Protection

Nirbhaya Setu combines six innovative features designed for maximum safety effectiveness and user empowerment in daily urban life. Each feature addresses specific safety challenges women face.

AI-Powered Safety Map


Dynamic, time-specific safety scores based on real-time lighting data, crowd density analytics, and historical incident patterns.

Hotspot Detection

Automatically flags high-crime areas during specific hours, empowering informed route decisions based on data.

Community Feedback Loop: Women rate and review areas in real-time, directly improving AI model accuracy and creating collective intelligence.

Intelligent Route Monitoring: Detects deviations from planned routes and alerts users to unexpected changes such as ride-share diversions.

Multiple SOS Options: Panic button, discreet code words, and automatic triggering via wearables or biometric anomalies give users control.

Robust IoT Integration: Seamless connections with smart city infrastructure, public CCTV networks, and personal safety devices for comprehensive coverage.

Scenarios: Safety in Action

These real-world scenarios demonstrate how Nirbhaya Setu transforms safety outcomes in everyday situations women face. Technology meets actionable intelligence.

Scenario 1: Planning a Safe Evening

A woman plans to visit a market at 9:00 PM. Nirbhaya Setu displays a low safety rating due to poor lighting and high crowd density. Reviews from local women corroborate the risk. Empowered by this data, she selects an app-suggested safe alternate route with better lighting and higher community ratings, avoiding potential danger before it occurs.


Scenario 2: Detecting a Threat

A woman books a ride-share cab. The driver unexpectedly diverts onto a secluded route. Nirbhaya Setu's anomaly detection immediately flags the deviation and sends a warning alert. She discreetly activates an emergency trigger using a pre-set code word. An immediate distress signal with live location streams to her guardians and the nearest police unit simultaneously.
